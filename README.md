# Insightly.ai – Customer Feedback Intelligence API

Insightly.ai is a backend service for analyzing customer feedback using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The API performs **sentiment classification** (Negative, Neutral, Positive) on textual reviews, such as Google Play Store reviews, to help businesses gain actionable insights from user feedback.

This service is built with **FastAPI** and powered by a **Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)** fine-tuned on real-world review data.

---

## Key Features

- Sentiment analysis for customer reviews
- Transformer-based NLP model (DistilBERT)
- Fast and lightweight FastAPI backend
- Ready-to-deploy for cloud platforms (Render, Railway, etc.)
- RESTful API, easy to integrate with any frontend

---

## Model Overview

- **Task**: Sentiment Classification
- **Labels**: Negative, Neutral, Positive
- **Architecture**: DistilBERT
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers
- **Training Environment**: Google Colab

### Evaluation Summary

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Accuracy | 75% |
| Macro F1-score | 0.66 |
| Weighted F1-score | 0.75 |

> Note: The Neutral class remains challenging due to class imbalance, which can be improved in future iterations.
